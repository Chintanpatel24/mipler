## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Connecting cards

Each card has 4 connection handles — top, bottom, left, right — positioned **outside** the card border so they're easy to grab without focusing the card first. Drag from any handle to any other handle to create a connection. Double-click any connection line to style it.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+Z | Undo |
| Backspace / Delete | Delete selected card or connection |
| Scroll | Zoom canvas |
| Click + drag canvas | Pan |

## Export & Import

Export saves a single JSON file containing every investigation, all card data, edge styles, API keys, and AI history. Import replaces the current workspace with the imported file — everything comes back exactly as left.
